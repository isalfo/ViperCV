I studied Java and Spring for several months, until I got kind of bored (very interesting indeed). Then I tried JavaScript and Angular, and I really enjoyed it. I like front end, I’ve been very in touch with design tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop back on my musician days. Recently I was offered a position on Globant’s iOS mobile Academy, and I took it. I’ve never had an iPhone or Mac in my life, but I’m learning a lot and I think this may be my path.", hobbies: "I studied music for several years before becomming a developer. I play piano, bass, guitar and other string instruments, so I enjoy producing, writing, even sometimes spending my hollydays on some beautifull city making music. It's also my secondary job and most of my social life!", skills: ["OOP", "Swift", "VIPER", "GIT", "TeamWork"]))
